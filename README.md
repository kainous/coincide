# Program allowing object subcategories

<dl>
  <dt>Plainly Deallocated Objects (PDO)</dt>
  <dd>Objects that deallocate when consumed</dd>
  <dt>Securely Deleted Objects (SDO)</dt>
  <dd>Objects that delete corresponding data when consumed</dd>
  <dt>Garbage Collected Objects (GCO)</dt>
  <dd>Objects that are garbage collected when no longer in use</dd>

Each category defines its own memory management according to linear memory region

# Recognition of the need for reflection as quasi-quotation

# Need for lazy evaluation that can be eagerly evaluated as needed
- This will prevent the requirements for things like creating async/await patterns for all functions that speak to IO

# Ability to rewrite linear typed code into a non-linear monad

# Type System for Disk Access
